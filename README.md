# Mandelbrot-Viewer
Simple Mandelbrot Viewer and explorer implemented with Java and Processing

## Functionality
It allows for progressive zooming into the Mandelbrot set visualization at any point. 

Precision is limited mainly by max iterations. This can be modified in the main sketch file to achieve better results
